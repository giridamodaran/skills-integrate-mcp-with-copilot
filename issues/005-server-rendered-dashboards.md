# 005 — Server-rendered dashboards for roles

**Summary**
Add simple server-rendered dashboard pages (or templated UI) for ADMIN, FACULTY, and STUDENT that provide quick navigation to role-specific actions.

**Motivation**
The Ayushmanas repo has distinct dashboards with direct actions (enroll, view, edit, delete). These are convenient for non-API users.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Dashboard pages for each role that require authentication.
- Buttons/links to key flows: enrollment, profile search, activity management.
- Reuse templates and static assets where possible.

**Estimate**: Small

**Labels**: frontend, ui, enhancement
