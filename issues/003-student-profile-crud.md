# 003 — Student profile CRUD

**Summary**
Implement full create/read/update/delete operations for student profiles with fields similar to `stud_adm` (name, admission no, DOB, class, branch, faculty assigned, activity, photo path, etc.).

**Motivation**
The Ayushmanas project provides detailed student profiles and admin edit/delete workflows.

**Acceptance criteria**
- API endpoints (and optional simple server-rendered pages) to create, view, edit, and delete student profiles.
- Data validation and sensible defaults.
- Photos stored as file paths referencing the upload feature (see issue 004).

**Estimate**: Medium

**Labels**: backend, api, feature
